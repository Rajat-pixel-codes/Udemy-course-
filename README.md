# The-Complete-Python-3-Course-Beginner-to-Advanced-Udemy-Course

In this repository, I have uploaded all the exercises and projects that I have done so far from a Udemy Course (The Complete Python 3 Course: Beginner to Advanced!). I have made a few customizations and modified all the exercises and projects. So, they may look different from the original course content. Tried out a few things differently to learn more!
